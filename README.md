## About

In our report, we examine the causal effect of gender stereotypes on character perception in science fiction fantasy (SFF) literature. We conducted an experiment to answer the question: **Are science fiction characters perceived differently based on their gender in terms of warmth, competence, and respect?** We addressed this research question by recruiting participants to read a science fiction passage and evaluate the main character on the dimensions of warmth, competence, and respect. Participants received one of two versions of the same passage — a "male version" or "female version" — created by changing the pronouns associated with the main character. We found that those who received the male treatment passage perceived the main character to be warmer and more competent than those who received the female treatment passage. However, the small effect size and statistical insignificance of our results suggest that the quality of our original data may have impacted the observed patterns in our outcome measures.
